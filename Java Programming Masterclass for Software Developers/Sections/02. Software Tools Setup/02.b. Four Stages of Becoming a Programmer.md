## Unconscious Incompetence

- When you're starting out, the decisions are hard to make
- you don't know,
  - languages
  - frameworks
  - area of interest, that you want to get into for programming
- basically **Where To Start**
- You don't know what's involved in a particular language, to get to a certain level
- Learn and Recognize, that you don't have all the answers, and you want to acquire the skills you need to basically proceed
- It is too early to decide on the area of interest
- Finish the first course first and then start looking at making decisions after that

> Don't Try and Make Long-Term decisions on Where you are going and what you are doing
> Focus on the basics

## Conscious Incompetence

- You recognize that you don't have the skills you need to become a programmer, or to get into the specific area of interest
- Also, you've got a real want to acquire those skills
- You've recognized that there's a value there for you to learn those skills

> You're gonna start, you're learning and you're gonna make tonnes of mistakes

## Conscious Competence

- You understand the basics of the programming language
- but, you really have to focus on understanding this
- you've got this worry in the back of you mind, that if you're gonna remember all this stuff
- if you're not constantly immersing yourself in training and practise, some of this information is going away

> The Training is now starting to make sense

## Unconscious Competence

- This is the level you wanna be untimately
- Programming becomes second nature to you
- You're feeling much more in command
- You can teach this material to other people

> You've got the core skills
