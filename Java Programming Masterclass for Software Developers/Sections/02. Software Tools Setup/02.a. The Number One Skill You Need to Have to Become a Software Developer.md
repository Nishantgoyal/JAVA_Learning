# The Number One Skill You Need to Have to Become a Software Developer

- [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsg5P40x8xo)
- The skill to become a software developer is NOT:
  - ~~learning a particular programming language, say JAVA, C++, etc~~
  - ~~having better hardware/computer~~
  - ~~working for a particular place or company~~
  - ~~technology~~
- It is all about an important concept, called, **_persistence_**
- When starting learning any skill, including programming
  - you are going to get frustrated at many stages
  - don't wanna go on
  - can't figure out a solution
- You need to PERSIST through all of that
- Learning any new skill is going to be hard and challanging
- You need to persevere and push through that
- Not been able to apply a concept, even if you have learnt and understood the same, is a natural part of programming. Persist through that.
- Over time you will get better at this, and things will make more sense
