# Floating Point Precision and a Challenge

```java
int myIntValue = 5 / 3;         //  --> 1
float myFloatValue = 5f / 3f;   //  --> 1.6666666
double myDoubleValue = 5d / 3d; //  --> 1.6666666666666667
```

- As evident, double has much higher precision after the decimal point (16 digits after decimal), while float is less precise (6 digits)
- `Double` data type is recommended
  - faster on modern computers (64-bit instruction set)
  - Java libraries are written to process double

## Challenge

- Convert a given number of pounds to kilograms
- Steps
  1. Create a variable with the appropriate type to store the number of pounds to be converted to Kilograms
  2. Calculate the result i.e. the number of kilograms based on the contents of the variable above and store the result in a 2nd appropriate variable
  3. Print out the result
- HINT: 1 pound is equal to 0.45359237 of a Kilogram

```java
double weightInPounds = 20.0d;
double conversionFactor = 0.45359237d;
double weightInKiloGrams = weightInPounds * conversionFactor;
```

## Instructor Comment - Precision Tips

- `float` and `double` are great for floating point operations
- but, both are not great where precision calculations are required
- It is due to the limitation with how floating point numbers are stored, and not a Java problem as such
- Java jas a class called `BigDecimal` that overcomes this
- When precise calculations are required, such as preforming currency calculations, floating-point types `should not be used`
