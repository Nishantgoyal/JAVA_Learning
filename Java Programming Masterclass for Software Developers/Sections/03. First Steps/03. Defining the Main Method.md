# Defining the Main Method

```java
// file_name: hello.java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

- Method
  - A collection of statements that performs an operation
- `Main method`
  - It is a special method that java looks for when running a program
  - It's called the entry point for java code
- `public` is the same access modifier keyword
- `static` to be explained later
- `void` keyword is used to indicate that the method will not return anything
- The left and right parantheses is mandatory for method declaration, and can include one or more parameters
- The left and right curly braces are used to define a code block for the method
  - The code block contains the `statements` that the method will be performing
- A Statement is a complete command to be executed and can include one or more `expressions`
