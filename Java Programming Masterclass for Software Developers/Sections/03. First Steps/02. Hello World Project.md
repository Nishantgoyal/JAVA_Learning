# Hello World Project

1. Create the first Java Class

```java

public class Hello {

}
```

- Java (and other) programming languages have keywords, each with a specific meaning, and sometimes they need to be used in specific orders
- `public` and `class` are two such Java Keywords
- `public` keyword is an _access modifier_
  - It allows us to define the `scope` or how other parts of your code or someone else's code can access this code
  - `public` access modifier will give full access
- `class` keyword is used to define a class with
  - **the name** following the keyword: _Hello_ in this case
  - left and right curly braces to define the class body
- To define a class, requires
  - an optional access modifier
  - class
  - class body inside the left and right curly braces
