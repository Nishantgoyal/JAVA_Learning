# byte, short, long and width

- These are additional whole number data types

## byte/short

- Smaller data type, with less range
- Not used frequently
- Can be used for efficiency

## long

- Large data type, with high range
- long literals are suffixed with `l` or `L`, e.g.,

```java
long myLongValue = 100L;
```

## Size of primitive types and Width

- A `Byte` occupies 8 bits
- A bit is not directly represented in a primitive type
- We say therfore that a `byte` has a width of 8
- A `short` occupies 16 bits, and has a width of 16
- An `int` occupies 32 bits, and has a width of 32
- A `long` occupies 64 bits, and has a width of 64

## Instructor Comments - Casting

- An `int` fully fits inside the range of a Long, and hence when assigning an `int variable` or an `int literal` to a `long variable`, it is implicitely casted (converts) to `long`

```java
// Stmt-1
long bigLongLiteralValue = 214748364712; // --> Will throw an error
// Stmt-2
long bigLongLiteralValue = 214748364712L; // --> is OK
```

- Stmt-1 will throw an error, as Java will consider the literal value `214748364712` as an `int literal` and since it is outside the range of an `int literal`, error will be thrown
