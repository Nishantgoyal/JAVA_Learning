# Variables

- A way to store information in our computer
- The variables are defined by a name called the `variable name`
- The content stored inside the variable is called the `value of the variable`

## Data Types

- These are different types of data that can be defined to be stored in the variables
- Data Types are keywords in Java
- `int`
  - an abbreviation for `integer`, a whole number

## Declaration Statement

- Specify the data type
- Give the variable a name
- Optionally add an expression to initialize the variable with a value
- `<type> <name> = <value>;`
- The assignment of value to the variable is called `initialisation`
  - Initialisation is optional
  - In general, Java requires variables to be initialised before being used
- The part after the `=` sign is called an `expression` in java
  - An expression is a construct that evaluates to a single value

```java
// ...
int myFirstNumber = 5;
// ...
```

## Challenge

- Similar to the `hello.java` program, create a print statement to print out the value of the variable `myFirstNumber`

```java
// file: myFirstNumber.java
public class myFirstNumber {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myFirstNumber = 5;
    System.out.println(myFirstNumber);
  }
}
```

```java
// Wrong output Case 1
public class myFirstNumber {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myFirstNumber = 5;
    System.out.println("myFirstNumber");
  }
}
```

- We are printing a `String Literal` here and not the variable itself
- Any sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes is a String literal in Java
  - Unlike variable, the value of a String literal cannot be changed

```java
// ...
int myFirstNumber = (10 + 5) * (2 * 10) // --> 35
// ...
```

- Here, the expression on the right will be calculated first, and the result will be assigned to the variable
- The expression contains multiple operators
  - Operators perform an operation on a variable or value
  - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` are four common operators
