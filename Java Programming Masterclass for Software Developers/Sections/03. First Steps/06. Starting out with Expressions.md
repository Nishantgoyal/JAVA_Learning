# Starting out with Expressions

## Challenge - 1

- Create additional variables
- `mySecondNumber` which is an `int` and assign a value of `12` to it
- `myThirdNumber` which is an `int` and assign a value of `6` to it

```java
// ...
int mySecondNumber = 12;
int myThirdNumber = 6;
// ...
```

## Challenge - 2

- Create a new Variable call `myLastOne`
- We want the value to be `1000 less` the current value of `myTotal` - the data type is `int`
- Print out the value of `myLastOne`

```java
// ...
int myTotal = myFirstNumber + mySecondNumber + myThirdNumber;
int myLastOne = 1000 - myTotal;
System.out.println(myLastOne);
// ...
```
