# Logical `AND` Operator

| Conditional Operator | Operator Name             | E.g.    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| ==                   | Equals to                 | 5 == 5  |
| !=                   | Not equals to             | 5 != 4  |
| <                    | less than                 | 5 < 20  |
| <=                   | less then or equals to    | 5 <= 20 |
| >                    | greater then              | 5 > 2   |
| >=                   | greater than or equals to | 5 >= 2  |

- To join two conditionals and return `true` if-and-only-if both are true, we can use `&&` (logical AND) operator
