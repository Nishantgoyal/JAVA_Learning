# The char and boolean Primitive Data Types

## char

```java
char myChar = 'D';
```

- The `char` is different to a string
- A `literal string` is some text in double quotes
- A `char` can only store single character
- `char myChar = 'DD';` will result in an error, as 'DD' is not a char literal
- `char` is less relevant today as memory issues are less prone
- `char` occupies two bytes of memory, or 16 bits and thus has a width of 16.
- It allows you to store Unicode characters
- By using a combination of two bytes that a `char` takes up in memory, it can represent any one of `65535` different types of characters

| Char | Unicode  |
| ---- | -------- |
| 'D'  | '\u0044' |
| 'Â©'  | '\u00A9' |

## Unicode

```java
char myUnicodeChar = '\u0044';
```

- It is an international encoding standard
- Each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value
- It applies across different platforms and programs
- `char literal` can also be represented via the code by prepending `'\u'`

## bool

- A `boolean primitive` type can be set to two values
  - true
  - false
