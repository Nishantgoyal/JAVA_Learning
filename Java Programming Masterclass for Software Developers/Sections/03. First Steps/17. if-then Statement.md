# if-then Statement

- It is the most basic of all control flow statements
- It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to `true`

## Conditional Logic

- It uses specific statements in Java to allow us to check a condition and execute certain code based on whether that condition (the expression) is `true` or `false`

```java
boolean isAlien = false;
if (isAlien == false)
    System.out.println("It is not an alien");
```

- There is no semicolon after the `if` statement
- The `if` statement is spanning over two lines
- `isAlien == false` is testing whether the contents of the variable `isAlien` are `false`
- The operator `==` checks whether operands on its either side are equal or not
- The `if` keyword, taked into account the result of the expression inside the paranthesis, and if-and-only-if the result is `true`, the statement after it is executed
- `If` statement can be confusing in this way, as only one statement after the `if` block will be in range of the condition
- To include multiple statements in the conditional range, we can use a code block

## Code Block

- A **code block** allows more than one statement to be executed by a if statement

```java
if (expression) {
    // Code Block
    // Put one or more statements here
}
```

- ALWAYS USE A CODE BLOCK
