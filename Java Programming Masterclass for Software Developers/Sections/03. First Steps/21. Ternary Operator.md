# Ternary Operator

```java
boolean isCar = false;
boolean wasCar = isCar ? true : false;
```

- This operator has three operands
- 1st operand `isCar` is a condition, which should evaluate to `true` or `false`
- The 2nd operand is assigned to the variable is the 1st operand is `true`
- else the 3rd operand is assigned to the variable
- This Operator is a shortcut to assigning one of two values to a variable depending on a given condition
