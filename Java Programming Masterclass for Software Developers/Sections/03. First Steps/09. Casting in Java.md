# Arithmetic and Casting in Java

```java
// No Error
int myIntNumber = (myMinIntValue / 2);
// Error-Stmt
byte myByteNumber = (myMinByteValue / 2);
```

- The reason we get an error is cause the expression `(myMinByteValue / 2)` contains an `int literal - 2` and will result in a `int` value
- Even though we know the resultant `int` will fit in `byte` range, Java can not conclude that

## Casting

```java
byte myByteNumber = (byte) (myMinByteValue / 2);
```

- It means to treat or convert a number from one type to another
- We are telling Java to treat the result of the expression `(myMinByteValue / 2)` as `byte`
