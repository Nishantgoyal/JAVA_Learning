# Assignment Operator VS Equals to Operator

## Challenge 1

```java
int newValue = 50;
if (newValue = 50) {
  System.out.println("This should print, if No Error!");
}
```

- The error is that inside the `if` condition check, a single `=` operator is used, which is the assignment operator
- Instead, what is required is the `==` operator which is the conditional equality operator and returns `true` if LHS and RHS of `==` are equal

### Solution 1

```java
int newValue = 50;
if (newValue == 50) {
  System.out.println("This should print, if No Error!");
}
```

## Challenge 2

```java
boolean isCar = false;
if (isCar = true) {
  System.out.println("This is not supposed to happen!");
}
```

- The assignment operator inside the `if` conditional will assign a value of `true` to `isCar` variable
- This would result in the condition being equal to `true`, which is Not the intended logic of the code
- It will also not result in a Syntax Error, cause the assignment operator is returning a boolean variable

### Solution 2

```java
boolean isCar = false;
if (isCar == true) {
  System.out.println("This is not supposed to happen!");
}
```

- we can simplify the conditional by only specifying the `isCar` variable
- To check for `isCar == false`, we can use `!` (NOT) operator, i.e., `!isCar`

## The `NOT` Operator

- The `!` or `NOT` operator is also known as Logical Complement Operator
- For use with `booleans` it tests the alternate value

- The abbreviated form for conditional check is recommended
  - Avoids the potential error by accidentally using an assignment operator
  - code is more concise

```java
boolean isCar = false;
if (isCar) {
  System.out.println("This is not supposed to happen!");
}
if (!isCar) {
  System.out.println("This is supposed to happen!");
}
```
