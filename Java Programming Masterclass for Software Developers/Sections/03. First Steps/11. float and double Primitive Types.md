# float and double Primitive Types

- Unlike whole numbers, floating point numbers have a fractional parts
- we express the floating part with a decimal point
- There are two primitive types in Java to express floating points
  - `float` --> Single precision number
  - `double` --> Double precision number

```java
float myFloatValue = 5.24; // --> Will raise an error
```

- The statement `float myFloatValue = 5.24;` raises an error cause, `5.24` is interpreted as `double literal` and hence results in an error when assigning to the `float` variable
- The `double` data type is considered to be the default by java for a floating point literal
- We can specify the type of the floating point literal by specifing
  - `f` for `float literal`
  - `d` for `double literal`

## Precision

- It referes to the format and the amount of space occupied by the type
- Single precision occupies `32 bits`, and has a width of 32
- Double precision occupies `64 bits`, and has a width of 64

## Challenge

- cast `5.24` to float to assign to `float myFloatValue`

```java
float myFloatValue = (float) 5.24;
```
