# String Data Type

- `String` is not a primitive data type
- `String` is a **Class**
- A `String` is a sequence of characters

```java
String myString = "This is a String";
myString = myString + 123; // -->This is a String123
```

- String can be appended using a `+` operator. It is called Concatenation
- Java does implicit casting if we try to append a number or floating type literal to a string
- Strings in Java are `immutable`
  - It means, Strings cannot change after they are created
  - Everytime a string is modified, it results in the creation of a new String
- There is another class called `StringBuffer` which is better for working with String modifications as it is Mutable in nature
