# Logical `OR` Operator

- Works in similar way as `&&` (logical AND), but instead of requiring both the conditionals to be `true`, `||` (logical OR) operator returns `true` if any of the condition is `true`

## Instructor Comments - Bitwise Operator

- The single `&` is a bitwise `AND` operator, while the single `|` is a bitwise `OR` operator
