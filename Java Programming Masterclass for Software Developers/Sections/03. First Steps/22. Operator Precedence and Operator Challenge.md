## Operator Challenge

1. Create a double variable with a value of 20.00
2. Create a second variable of type double with the value of 80.00
3. Add both numbers together and multiply by 100.00
4. Use the remainder operator to figure out what the remainder from the result of the operation in step 3 and 40.00
5. Create a boolean variable that assigns the value true if the remainder in #4 is 0, or false otherwise
6. Output the boolean variable
7. Write an if-then statement that displays the message "Got some remainder" if the boolean in step 5 is not true.

```java
double myVar = 20.00;
double mySecVar = 80.00;
double totalVar = (myVar + mySecVar) * 100.00;
double remainder = totalVar % 40.00;
boolean isRemainderZero = (remainder == 0) ? true: false;
System.out.println(isRemainderZero);
if (!isRemainderZero) {
  System.out.println("Got some remainder");
}
```
