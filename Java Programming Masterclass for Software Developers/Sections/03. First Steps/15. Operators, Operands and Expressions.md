# Operators, Operands and Expressions

## Operators

- Special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result
- e.g., `+`, `*`, etc.
- for `int x = 2 + 3;`
  - there are two operators
  - `+` is an arithmetic operator which adds `2` and `3`
  - `=` is an assignment operator, which assigns the result of the right hand side to the variable on the left hand side

## Operand

- It refers to the objects that are manipulated by an operator
- e.g.,
  - `int x = 2 + 3;`
    - `2` and `3` are operands
  - `double mySalary = hoursWorked * hourlyRate`
    - both `hoursWorked` and `hourlyRate` are operands

## Expression

- It is formed by combining
  - variables
  - literals
  - method return values
  - and operators
- e.g.,
  - `int x = 2 + 3;`
    - `2 + 3` is an expression
  - `double mySalary = hoursWorked * hourlyRate`
    - `hoursWorked * hourlyRate` is an expression

## Instructor Comments - Comment

- **Comments** are ignored by the computer
- These and are added to a program to help describe something
- **Comments** are created using `//` in front of a line to be commented
- Apart from describing, comments can be used to temporarily describe code

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Operation      |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| \*       | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulus        |
