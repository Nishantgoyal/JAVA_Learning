# Methods In Java

- If the code is duplicated, then

  - it is prone to changes at one place, while not at other
  - more effort, not convinient
  - easily susceptible to errors

- Methods
  - is a better way of ensuring the code isn't duplicated
  - create code in a dedicated area
  - use them repeatedly
  - makes the code lot easier to maintain

## Defining a new method

```java
class ... {
  // method -- main
  public static void main(...) {...}
  // method definition for method_name
  public static void method_name(param1_type param1, param2_type param2, ...) {
    // Method Statements
    // Anything here is part of the method - method_name
    // `param1`, `param2` are the parameters that will be passed in to the method
  }
  public static int calculateSquare(int num) {
    int square = num * num;
    return square;
  }
}
```

- When the method is executed
  - all the code inside the method is executed
- To execute the method, just type
  - `method_name(arg1, arg2, ...)`
    - `arg1`, `arg2` will be the values that will be put in the corresponding parameters
    - The data type and sequence of args should match with the parameters exactly
    - Java will create variables of `param_type` inside the method with value `arg`
- Methods can also send back the result of some calculation it is doing
- The `void` keyword in the method defination means
  - Do not send any thing back
- We can replace the `void` keyword in the method defination
  - Use a data type like `int`, `float`, etc
  - the method should then return data corresponding to the data type
- To return data from a method,
  - use the `return` keyword
- When we are returning data back from the method, ensure that
  - data is returned in all cases, irrespective of any condition
