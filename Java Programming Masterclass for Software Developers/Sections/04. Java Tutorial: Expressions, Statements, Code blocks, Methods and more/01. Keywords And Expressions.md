# Keywords And Expressions

## Keywords

- A Keyword is one of the reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language
- Keywords cannot be used for `variables`, `methods`, `classes`, or as any other identifier

## Expressions

- These are built with values, variables, operators, and method calls
- e.g.,
  - For the statement `double kilometres = (100 * 1.609344);`, the actual expression is `kilometres = (100 * 1.609344)`
  - `if (20 > 4) {...}`, `20 > 4` is an expression

## Challenge

- From the code below, write down that parts of the code that are expressions

```java
int score = 100;
if (score > 99) {
  System.out.println("You got the high score!");
  score = 0;
}
```

- Expressions:
  - `score = 100`
  - `score > 99`
  - `"You got the high score!"`
  - `score = 0`
