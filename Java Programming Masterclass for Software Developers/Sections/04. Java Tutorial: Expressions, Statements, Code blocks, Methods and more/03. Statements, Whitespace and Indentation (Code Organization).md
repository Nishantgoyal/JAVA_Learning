# Statements, Whitespace and Indentation (Code Organization)

```java
int myVariable = 50;
```

- `myVariable = 50` is an Expression
- The entire line is called a Statement, i.e., `int myVariable = 50;`
- Other Statement examples:
  - `myVar++;`
  - `System.out.println(...);`
- A Semicolon at the end of the line is usually used to finish a statement, but there are exceptions
- We can continue a statement on multiple lines, or have multiple statements on one line

## WhiteSpace

- It is the space between statements, expressions, variables, operators, etc
- Java does not throw error on excess of whitespace

## Indentation

- It is the act of indenting the code to make it more readable
- It also helps in showing the logical flow of the code
