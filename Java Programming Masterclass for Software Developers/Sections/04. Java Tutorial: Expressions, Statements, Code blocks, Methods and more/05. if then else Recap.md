# if then else Recap

- The `if` statement identifies which statement or code block to run
  - based on the value of an expression
- Inside the code block defined by curly braces `{}`
  - we can have one or more statements
- We can use the `else` statement after the `if`, In this case,
  - when the condition inside the original `if` is false, then the `else` block is executed
- We can also add multiple `else if` to test multiple conditions

```java
if(condition_1) {
  // will be executed on `condition_1` being true
  // IF BLOCK
} else if(condition_2) {
  // will be executed on `condition_1` being false and `condition_2` being true
  // IF BLOCK
} else {
  // will be executed on `condition_1` and `condition_2` being false
  // ELSE BLOCK
}
```
