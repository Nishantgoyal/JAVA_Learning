# Code Blocks And The If Then Else Control Statements

## Code Blocks

- It is used to group statements in order to apply conditional logic on their execution
- `{...}` is used to create a code block

## If-Else

```java
int score = 5000;
if (score < 5000 && score > 1000) {
  System.out.println("Score less then 5000");
} else if (score < 1000) {
  System.out.println("Score was less then 1000");
} else {
  System.out.println("Got here");
}
```

## Instructor Comments - Scope

```java
boolean gameOver = true;
int levelCompleted = 5;
int score = 5000;
int bonus = 100;
if (gameOver == true) {
  int finalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
  System.out.println("Your final score was " + finalScore);
}
// Error
int savedScore = finalScore;
```

- `int savedScore = finalScore` will throw an error, cause the variable `finalScore` is inside the `if` code-block
- Outside the `if` code-block the variable `finalScore` does not exist
- This concept is called `Scope`, and it deals with the accessibility of variables in certain situations or in certain places in the code
- In essence: If you create a variable inside a code block, you cannot access the variable outside the code block
- You can access variables in codeblocks which are created outside the code block

## Challenge - 1

- Print out a second score on the screen with the following:
  - score set to 10000
  - levelCompleted set to 8
  - bonus set to 200
  - But make sure the first printout above still displays as well

### Solution - 1

```java
boolean gameOver = true;
int levelCompleted = 8;
int score = 10000;
int bonus = 200;
if (gameOver == true) {
  int finalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
  System.out.println("Your final score was " + finalScore);
}
```

### Instructor Solution - 1

- Create a complete new set of variables
- Uses excess memory
- A lot of copy paste and code repetition

### Instructor Solution - 2

- Reuse same variables
- A lot of copy paste and code repetition
- We have lost info about the previous game
- Tracking multiple games is not possible
- Code is repeting and so, any change required in logic will have to be applied at multiple places
